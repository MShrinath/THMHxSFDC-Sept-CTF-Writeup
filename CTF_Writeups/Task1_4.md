## ❓ Challenge Story
Secrets do not always hide in logs and ledgers. Sometimes they slip through the voices of customers. The portal proudly echoes whatever is spoken, yet it does so without care. Clever diners have noticed that when reflections are repeated without question, even a casual remark can twist into something dangerous. In that distortion, another secret of Chef’s book is exposed.
