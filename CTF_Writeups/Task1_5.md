## ❓ Challenge Story
Behind the scenes of the portal lies a private ledger, a section meant only for trusted staff accounts. The locks on its digital shelves are weaker than they appear. A determined user who tampers with the right identifier can bypass the restriction and stumble upon records that were never meant for their eyes. Hidden among them lies yet another piece of the Chef’s secret book.
