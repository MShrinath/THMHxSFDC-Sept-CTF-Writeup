## ❓ Challenge Story
Buried deep within the portal is the Archivist’s ledger, a digital record of recipes and notes that staff thought were long forgotten. It was meant only for the Chef and his closest aides. Yet the ledger is not guarded carefully. With the right kind of request, it reveals more than it should, including another fragment of the Chef’s secret book.
